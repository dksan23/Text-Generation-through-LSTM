# Text-Generation-through-LSTM
The notebook contains the implementation of  an LSTM in tensorflow .
The LSTM takes as input the sequences of one hot encoded vectors of tyhe characters in the vocabulary.
The LSTM after training is able to generate text of the same pattern.
This was created as an exercise in the Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree.
